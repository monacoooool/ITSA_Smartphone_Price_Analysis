# ITSA_Smartphone_Price_Analysis
By analyzing the sanctions imposed on Huawei during the previous Trump administration (05-16-2019), we will investigate how the smartphone market responded to this decision and assess its impact on pricing trends.

## Prerequisites

The following Python libraries are required to run the ITSA analysis:

```plaintext
- pandas        # Data manipulation and CSV file reading
- numpy         # Numerical computations
- statsmodels   # Statistical modeling and ITSA implementation

## Getting Started

To run the ITSA analysis, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ITSA_Smartphone_Price_Analysis.git
cd ITSA_Smartphone_Price_Analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete analysis
python scripts/main_analysis.py data/smartphone_prices.csv

## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing (`python/data_preprocessing.py`)
- Handling missing values
- Converting date formats for time series analysis
- Creating pre- and post-intervention variables
- Normalizing price values

### 2. Basic Statistical Analysis (`python/statistical_tests.py`)
- Descriptive statistics
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- Outlier analysis
- Correlation matrices

### 3. Normality Tests (`python/statistical_tests.py`)
- Shapiro-Wilk test
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Jarque-Bera test
- Anderson-Darling test
- Bonferroni correction for multiple tests
- Statistical power analysis

### 4. Visualizations (`python/visualization.py`)
- Time series plots with trendlines
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Q-Q plots for normality assessment

### 5. ITSA Model Estimation (`python/itsa_model.py`)
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression for ITSA
- Pre- and post-intervention slope estimation
- Statistical significance assessment
- Confidence intervals for model parameters

### 6. Post-Model Diagnostics and Validation (`python/robustness_check.py`)
- Residual analysis for model validation
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity assessment
- Robustness index calculation
- Statistical power analysis for model stability

### 7. Results and Interpretation (`output/results/`)
- Exported statistical summaries
- Graphical outputs for publication
- Regression results for further interpretation

## Dataset Structure

The dataset should be saved in `data/` and includes the following variables:

- **date**: Release date of the smartphone
- **model**: Specific model name
- **price**: Original launch price of the smartphone
- **adjusted_price**: Inflation-adjusted price for standardization
